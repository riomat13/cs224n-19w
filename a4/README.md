# A4 Neural Machine Translation with RNNs

Note: Heavily inspired by the https://github.com/pcyin/pytorch_nmt repository 
(this note is from original `README.md`)


The codes used in this assignment are based on publicly opened version of *CS224n* with small modifications to run on local machine(*Jetson TX2*).

This is only for personal use for learning purpose and only tested with provided sanity check codes.

This codes run on following conditions.

```python
python==3.6
docopt==0.6.2
numpy==1.18.3
